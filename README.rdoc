= Object-factory

A ruby gem designed to make it simple to create test objects within your test framework, so you don't need to use nasty fixtures.  

If you don't use the a_saved method then it should work with any type of model, if you do use a_saved then it will work with any model that has a save method (that returns false on failure - so ActiveRecord and DataMapper should be OK).  

== Install

  gem install rahoulb-object-factory --source http://gems.github.com/
  
== Usage

See the wiki page at http://github.com/rahoulb/object-factory/wikis/home for the latest docs.

However, it works something like this: 

  when_creating_a Person, :auto_generate => :employee_code
 
  @person = a Person, :first_name => 'John', :last_name => 'Smith'
  puts @person.employee_code # will show a unique auto-generated value
  
And your options are: 

* :auto_generate => [:field1, :field2]: generates a unique string value for the given field name or array of field names
* :auto_confirm => :password: generates a unique string value for the given field name or array of field names and also sets field_name_confirmation to the same value
* :generate_email_address => :email: generates a randomised email address for the given field name or array of field names
* :generate_ip_address => :ip: generates a randomised ip address for the given field name or array of field names
* :set => { :field3 => 'value3', :field4 => 'value4' }: sets the given fields to the supplied static values
* :generate => { :field5 => lambda { Date.today } }: sets the given fields to the supplied dynamic values

== Rails

To use this with rails, stick the following in your +environment.rb+:

  config.gem "rahoulb-object-factory", :lib => "object_factory", :source => "http://gems.github.com"
